**Title: Secure MERN Stack Application with JWT Authentication**

**Description:**

This repository contains a full-stack MERN application implementing robust authentication mechanisms using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and a self-signed SSL certificate to ensure secure communication. Designed to showcase the powerful combination of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, this project serves as a practical example of building and securing a web application from scratch.

**Key Features:**

- **Secure User Authentication:** Utilizes JWT for secure token-based user authentication.
- **SSL/TLS Encryption:** Features a self-signed SSL certificate to encrypt data transmitted over the network, enhancing security for all users.
- **CRUD Operations:** Supports complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for managing assignments, demonstrated through a clean and intuitive API.
- **Responsive Design:** Front-end built with React.js, offering a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **MongoDB Database Integration:** Leverages MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval, showcasing schema design and data management within a NoSQL environment.
- **API Testing with Postman:** Includes detailed Postman collections for testing API endpoints, ensuring each function behaves as expected.
- **Environment Configuration:** Utilizes environment variables for configuring the database connection string and JWT secret, making the application easily configurable and secure.
- **Error Handling:** Implements comprehensive error handling strategies to provide clear feedback and ensure application reliability and stability.

**Technologies Used:**
- Frontend: React.js, HTML5, CSS3
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication: JWT
- Security: SSL/TLS with a self-signed certificate
- API Testing: Postman

**Getting Started:**
Instructions for setting up and running the application locally:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure the environment variables as per the `.env.example` file.
4. Generate a self-signed SSL certificate and place it in the designated directory.
5. Start the server using `npm start`.
6. Access the application through `https://localhost:3000` ensuring your browser accepts the self-signed certificate.
